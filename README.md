## Some details for using this API for the website
### The website is used to create a workable ecommerce site. This API does not take data to register an account. The
### register form in this site is just for a template but the login works, it works only with the premade accounts within the API (username and password).
### The products can be added to the cart with a plus, minus or add to cart button. The same can be done in the cart and the items can be removed.
### There is a persistent cart but it has some issues, it adds some items not clicked on.
### A Navigational bar is in the top middle for the Home, Login, Register, and the Cart.
